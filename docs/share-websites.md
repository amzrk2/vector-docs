import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

You can generate share links to make your statistics public, just like the online demo.

Navigate to `Settings -> Share` then click the adding button:

<img alt="Share Websites" src={useBaseUrl('img/share.jpg')} />

Select the website and set your expiration time, and just like getting the tracker code, you'll get a link which is public to everyone.
