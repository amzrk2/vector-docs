## About the Project

This project does not use semantic versioning until v1 is officially released, so please check the changelog carefully before each upgrade to see if it is still working properly.

## Quickstart

Checkout [MongoDB Atlas Guide](mongodb-atlas-guide) and [Serverless Guide](serverless-guide) to start the application without your own server.
