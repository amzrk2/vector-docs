## Server Mode

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 12.13 or later (latest 14.x LTS recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) 3.0.0 or later

## Serverless Mode

- [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction)
- [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/)

Other serverless services based on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) like Netlify Functions should also be compatible but there is no guarantee of full operation.

:::note
Check out the [Serverless Guide](serverless-guide) for details about serverless mode.

:::caution
Netlify Functions (AWS Lambda) support is still work in progress.
